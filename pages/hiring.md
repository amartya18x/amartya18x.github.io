I am looking for highly motivated PhD students and Postdocs, with a strong background
in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and programming. Reach out
to me if you are interested (and refer to this paragraph below in your
      email) in pursuing a PhD or Postdoc with me on topics in Theory and
      Foundations of Machine Learning, that you think will also be of
      interest to me. In your email,  
      <br>

      <ul>
      <li> <strong> If you are looking for a PhD position </strong>, describe your past educational and research experience,
      an ideal project you would like to work on in your first year,
      and why it may be interesting to me
      <li> <strong> If you are looking for a Postdoc position </strong>  why you think we would be a good match, what broad topics you would like to work on, and a couple of your past papers that you have really enjoyed working on.
      </ul>
      
      <br>
      Some topics I am personally interested in are
        <ul>
          <li><b>Trustworthy Machine Learning</b> including
          differential privacy, robustness, unlearning, certification, fairness
          etc. and </li>
          <li> <b>Learning with limited and imperfect data</b>
          including unlabelled data, noisy data, and under
          distribution shift.</li>
      </ul>
      See below for specific funded positions starting in 2025. If you already have funding or are interested in co-supervision by me, please reach out to me by email. <strong> For all positions, a strong background in mathematics and computer science is necessary.</strong>
