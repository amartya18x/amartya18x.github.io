Reach out to me if you are interested (and
        refer to this paragraph below in your email) in pursuing a PhD
        with me on topics in
        <ul>
          <li><b>Trustworthy Machine Learning</b> including
          differential privacy, robustness, certification, fairness
          etc and </li>
          <li> <b>Learning with limited and imperfect data</b>
          including unlabelled data, noisy data, and under
          distribution shift.</li>
      </ul>
      If you are interested in other topics, especially in Theory and
      Foundations of Machine Learning, that you think will also be of
      interest to me, feel free to send me an email describing your
      past work, an ideal project you would like to work on in your
      first year, and why it may be interesting to me.
